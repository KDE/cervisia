<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<ulink url="http://www.kde.org/apps/cervisia/">&cervisia;</ulink> is a
user friendly version control system front-end. The aim is to support &CVS; and
other version control system programs in a unified interface, featuring conflict
resolution, difference and history viewers, status for the working copy files,
and support for most version control functions. You can get &cervisia;
by building the kdesdk module or installing the kdesdk package provided by your
distribution. Currently, only &CVS; is supported, but other version control
systems may be integrated in the future.
</para>

<para>
A version control system is a tool to record, manage, and distribute
different versions of files. &CVS; is a version control system. It allows you
to share your modifications easily, as each of the contributors can work on their
local copy at the same time, without fear of overwriting each others'
modifications. It allows the recovery of past versions (useful for tracking
bugs), the creation of branches (for experimental development or for releases
of code) and more.
</para>

<para>
The main <firstterm>repository</firstterm> usually holds a collaborative
project (commercial or not), but you can take advantage of the nice revision
control features offered by &CVS; even for a project developed exclusively by
you. It is easy to set up a local repository, and you will gain the ability to
track changes that caused bugs, revert changes, avoid accidental loss of
information, &etc;.
</para>

<para>
The repository holds the project files, and every contributor keeps their
own local copy, named <firstterm>working copy</firstterm> or
<firstterm>sandbox</firstterm>; one can then add their modifications to the main
repository (a process called &quot;committing&quot;) and/or update their own
copy to reflect recent changes made by other contributors.
</para>

<sect1 id="accessing-repository">
<title>Accessing The Repository</title>

<para>
In this section, we show how to use the basic version control system
	functionality using &cervisia; to checkout modules from the
repository and work with them. To do that, you must have access to the
repository as a client, meaning that someone (probably the administrator of
the &CVS; repository) gave you an account on the server machine. Alternatively,
you can easily create a local repository for your own project.
</para>

<tip><para>
If you plan to develop a complex project, it is a good idea to use the
&CVS; features, even if you are the only developer. You can make all changes in
the working copy, and use &cervisia; (or any other &CVS; tool) to update and
commit. This way, you will gain the ability to track changes that caused bugs,
revert changes, avoid accidental loss of information, &etc;. Using &cervisia;, it
is simple to create a local repository.
</para>

<procedure>
<title>Creating a Local Repository</title>

<step><para>
Open the <guilabel>Create New Repository (cvs init)</guilabel>
dialog by choosing
<menuchoice><guimenu>Repository</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Create...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para></step>

<step><para>
Press the <guilabel>...</guilabel> button to select the folder where you want to
create the repository, or enter its location in the text box. For instance, if you
want to place the repository in the <filename>/home/user</filename> folder, and
to name it <filename>cvsroot</filename>, you should type
<filename>/home/user/cvsroot</filename> in the text box, or select the
<filename>/home/user</filename> folder using the file picker, and add
<filename>cvsroot</filename>.
</para></step>

<step><para>
Confirm by pressing the <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
button. &cervisia; will create and initialize the new repository folder.
</para></step>

<step><para>
Now you can import your current work to the repository, or simply create a
folder in the repository to start a new module from scratch.
</para></step>

</procedure>

</tip>


<para>
&cervisia; offers an integrated front-end to manage all your repository
locations, the <guilabel>Configure Access to Repositories</guilabel> dialog.
To display it, select the <menuchoice><guimenu>Repository</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Repositories...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item.

<para>
There are several methods to access a &CVS; repository. It may be reached via
password authentication (:pserver:), secure shell (using :ext:), local
repository (:local:), &etc;. The format for the repository location is
(optional items appear between square brackets):
</para>

<para>
<filename>[:method:][[user][:password]@]hostname[:[port]]/path/to/repository</filename>
</para>

<para>
Not all these items (user, password, hostname, port) are always necessary
to access the repository. The required information depends on the access method
used, which can be categorized as follows:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>Local</term>

<listitem>
<para>
The local access method is the default method used by &CVS;. Therefore, it is
optional to add the :local: method to the repository location: you can enter
simply the path to the folder which stores the &CVS;
repository, and is accessible from your computer, like
<filename class="directory">/path/to/repository</filename> or to give a real
life example, <filename class="directory">/home/cvs</filename>.</para>

<para>
It may physically be on a disk which is mounted via <acronym>NFS</acronym>,
but this is an irrelevant detail. If you created a local repository, the
location will be simple the path to it.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry id="rsh">
<term>&rsh;</term>

<listitem>
<para>
The repository location is something like
<filename>:ext:username@host.url.org:/path/to/repository</filename>.
</para>

<para>
This method requires that you have a user account on the server machine (in
this example, <systemitem class="systemname">host.url.org</systemitem>) and
use a remote shell for communication. By default, &CVS; uses &rsh; for this
purpose; however, &rsh; has long considered to be insecure, and is widely
replaced by &ssh;.
</para>

<para>
If you wish to use &ssh;, you must set the environment variable
$<envar>CVS_RSH</envar> to &ssh; when using the <command>cvs</command>
client. &cervisia; supports this easily.
</para>

<!-- TODO: verify if the above still apply -->

<para>
Note that &cervisia; cannot answer possible password requests from the
server machine. You must make sure that a remote login works without requiring
you to enter the password. With plain vanilla &rsh;, this can be achieved for
example by creating a <filename>.rhosts</filename> file in your home folder
with a list of trusted hosts (see the &rsh; manpage).
</para>

<para> 
With &ssh;, it can be achieved by copying your public key located in the file
<filename>identity.pub</filename>, located in the
<filename>$<envar>HOME</envar>/.ssh/</filename> folder to the server. In this
case, the key must not be encrypted with a passphrase (see the &ssh; manpage and
the &CVS;/<acronym>SSH</acronym> <acronym>FAQ</acronym> on
SourceForge). If you are unsure about these issues, ask your system
administrator.
</para>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>pserver</term>

<listitem>
<para>
The repository location looks like
<filename>:pserver:username@host.url.org:/path/to/repository</filename>
</para>

<para>
This method accesses the server via a special protocol with a relatively weak
authentication (<literal>pserver</literal> stands for password
authentication). Before you can use such a server, you need a username and
password given by the &CVS; server administrator, and you have to login. Note
that your &CVS; password authentication username does not necessarily match the
system's username. Before accessing the &CVS; server, you will need to login.
</para>

<para>
Open-source projects typically offer Anonymous &CVS; access to their
sources. This means you can easily grab the latest sources, modify, and create
patches (differences) against the repository without asking for a &CVS; account.
As a general rule, Anonymous &CVS; uses password authentication (:pserver:), and
is a read-only repository, not allowing you to upload your changes directly.
</para>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
Knowing the access method and location to the repository, you can add it
to &cervisia;'s repositories list:
</para>

<procedure>
<title>Adding a New Repository</title>

<step><para>
Open the <guilabel>Configure Access to Repositories</guilabel> dialog by
choosing the <menuchoice><guimenu>Repository</guimenu> 
<guimenuitem>Repositories...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item.
</para></step>

<step><para>
Press the <guilabel>Add...</guilabel> button to open the
<guilabel>Add Repository</guilabel> dialog.
</para></step>

<step><para>
Enter the repository location in the <guilabel>Repository:</guilabel> text box.
&cervisia; will automatically disable the areas of the dialog that are not
relevant to the access method you entered.
</para></step>

<step><para>
If you are using the ext method to access the repository, enter the remote shell
you wish to use (&eg; &ssh;) in the <guilabel>Use remote shell (only for :ext:
repositories):</guilabel> text box.
</para></step>

<step><para>
Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. You will see the repository you just entered
on the repositories list.
</para></step>

<step><para>
If the access method to the repository you just entered is password
authentication (pserver), you will need to login before connecting the server.
Click the repository on the list to select it, and press the
<guilabel>Login...</guilabel> button. Enter your password in the upcoming dialog.
</para>
<para>
If you successfully enter your password, the <guilabel>Status</guilabel>
column entry of the pserver repository will change from 
<guilabel>Not logged in</guilabel> to <guilabel>Logged in</guilabel>.
</para></step>

<step><para>
Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to apply your modifications, or add another
location to the list. &cervisia; will store as many locations as you like.
</para></step>

<sect1 id="importing">
<title>Importing a Module Into the Repository</title>

<para>
In this section, we discuss how you can put a new project into the &CVS;
repository. If you just want to work with an existing project which is already
in a repository, you may skip this section.
</para>

<para>
There are two ways to put a project into the &CVS;:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
Import the files and folders to a new <firstterm>module</firstterm>, using
&cervisia;'s import dialog. Modules are the top folders in the &CVS; repository
folder tree, and are used to separate and organize the different software
projects inside the repository.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Create an empty module and add the new files and folders manually. You will have
more control, but it will probably take a little more time.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<important>
<para>
Keep in mind that &CVS; was initially designed to handle
text files. Many features, like revision merging, creating differences in a
readable form, &etc; are only performed to text files. This does not mean you
cannot use &CVS; to keep binary files, it just means you have to
<emphasis>explicitly tell &CVS; if it is a text or binary file</emphasis>. If
you declare the wrong file type, you will experience problems with the &CVS;
functionality for these files, and they may get corrupted.
</para>
</important>


<para>
Importing a project (as a new module) has some advantages: you will import all
files and folders recursively, and the module will automatically be created
for you. This makes importing large existing projects to the repository
easier. However, there are some disadvantages: you cannot use &cervisia;'s import
dialog to add files to existing modules, and you can either import the files
as text or binary files. You can work around this limitation by creating a
folder with files of only one of the types, or by informing the patterns
of the files that should be ignored during the import process.
</para>

<para>
For instance, suppose your project contains text files and some PNG images
(binary files) only. You can tell &CVS; to ignore all files with the pattern
<filename class="extension">*.png</filename> while importing the other files as
text, or you can move the images to a separate folder, and then import
the remaining files (as text files). Either way, you will have to
<link linkend="checkingout">checkout</link> the newly imported module to a
new working copy, copy the missing files and folders to it,
<link linkend="addingfiles">add</link> and
<link linkend="committingfiles">commit</link> them to the repository to complete
the import process.
</para>

<para>
As an alternative, you can add the files and folders manually, creating an empty
module for them. To add an empty module to a repository, just create a new
folder in the &CVS; repository root folder. The name of this new folder will be
the name of the module. <link linkend="checkingout">Checkout</link> the new
empty module. Then copy the files and folders to the working copy,
<link linkend="addingfiles">add</link> and 
<link linkend="committingfiles">commit</link> to upload them to the &CVS;
repository.

This tag is also historically used for importing different versions of
third-party software. If you are not doing this, use the word
<literal>start</literal> or a string <literal>FOO_1_0</literal> where
<literal>FOO</literal> is the name of your project and <literal>1.0</literal>
is the version number of the imported release.

interpreted as a whitespace-separated list of file name patterns which are
ignored. In general, a cleaner and less error-prone way to control which files
go into the repository is to create a folder with only the files which you
want to import and start from that. Nevertheless, this entry may be useful if
the project contains files which are by default ignored by &CVS;, &eg; files
with the name <filename>core</filename>. In such a case, simply enter the
character <literal>!</literal> in this field: this overrules &CVS;'s scheme of

<sect1 id="checkingout">
<title>Checkout a Module From the Repository</title>
<para>
Now that you successfully defined your repository location, and imported the
initial files to the repository, it is time to retrieve the module from the
&CVS; repository, creating your working copy.
</para>

<para>
You should also know the name of the <firstterm>branch</firstterm> or
<firstterm>tag</firstterm> you want to use.
</para>

<para>
Branches of a module are parallel versions of this module. A good real-life
example of the use of this feature is the release of a software project. After a
major release, there are bugs in the code that should be fixed, but people want
to add new features to the application too. It is very hard to do both at the
same time because new features usually introduce new bugs, making it hard to
track down the old ones. To solve this dilemma, &CVS; lets you create a parallel
version, that we will call the &quot;stable release branch&quot;, where you can
only add bugfixes, leaving the main branch (HEAD) open for adding new features.
</para>

<para>
Tags are used to mark a version of a project. &CVS; stamps one
version of each file with the tag, so when you checkout or
update to a specific tag, you will get always the same file versions.
Therefore, in opposition to branches, tags are not dynamic: you cannot develop a
tag. Tags are useful to mark releases, big changes in the code, &etc;.
Using tags, you can easily return the project to a previous state, to reproduce and
track bugs, generate the release code again, &etc;.

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Module:</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
The name of the module to be checked out. If you are working with an existing
repository, you can probably get this name from the system administrator;
or, if it is an open-source repository, you can get the module names from the
project web pages. If you want to create a new module from scratch using a local
repository, just create a new folder in the local repository root folder. The
name of the folder will be the same as the name of the empty module.
</para>

Alternatively, if the repository has a

Note that it is possible to checkout any existing subfolder of the module,
without retrieving the rest of the module. Just enter the path to the subfolder 
as well. For instance, if you want to get only the

<title>The Main Screen, Viewing File Status and Updating</title>
<para>
When you start &cervisia;, and open a working copy by choosing
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Open Sandbox...</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>,
you can see two main areas in &cervisia;'s main window: the top one is a 
hierarchical (tree) view of the current working copy; the bottom area is
used to display the &CVS; commands &cervisia; issues to perform its tasks, as
well as the output generated by these commands.
</para>

<para>
By default, &cervisia; does not display the files contained by the sub-folders,
so you will have to click the folders you want to see. To display all files
of the working copy, select
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Unfold File Tree</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>.
To close back all folders from the working copy, choose
<menuchoice>

<guimenuitem>Fold File Tree</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>.
</para>

<para>
According to the settings in your
<filename>.cvsignore</filename> files, the files you usually do not want to
include into the repository - such as object files - are not shown in the tree
view. For each file, you see its corresponding status. In the default setting,
after opening the sandbox, this is "Unknown" because &cervisia; delays the
fetching of information until you select the files and folders whose status you
want to update or view and choose
<menuchoice>

<guimenuitem>Update</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
or
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>File</guimenu>

command to get status information for the marked files. Note that &cervisia;
goes recursively into subfolders only if you have the according option
in the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu set. According to the respective
file's status, you now see an entry in the <guilabel>Status</guilabel> column:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Locally Modified</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
This means you have modified the file compared to the
version in the repository.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Locally Added</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
This means the file does not exist in the repository, but in
your working copy and you have scheduled it for addition. The actual
insertion into the repository only happens after a commit.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Locally Removed</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
This means you have scheduled the file for removal, but it
still exists in the repository. The actual removal happens only after a
commit.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Needs Update</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
This is shown if a newer version of the file exists in the
repository, &eg; because someone committed a modification. Normally, you want
to update this file so you have an up-to-date version in your folder.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Needs Patch</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
This is essentially the same as before; the difference is 
that in case of an update, the &CVS; server transfers only a patch
instead of the whole file to you.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Needs Merge</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
Indicates that a merge of the revision of this file in your
working copy with the version in the repository is necessary. This
typically happens if you have made modifications to the file while
someone else has committed his modifications. If you choose to update, the
modifications in the repository are merged into your file. In case of a
conflict (&ie; if someone else has changed some of the same lines like you)
the new status is then "Conflict".
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Up to Date</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
Indicates that the file is identical with the version in the
repository.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Conflict</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
This is shown if this file still has conflict markers in it. Maybe
you have previously updated the file and not resolved the conflicts.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Not In CVS</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
Indicates that the file is not registered in the &CVS;
repository. If you want it to available for others, you should add it to the
repository. If not, you may consider adding it to your
<filename>.cvsignore</filename> file. 
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>
Now that you have got an overview of the current status of the &CVS;, you may
want to do an update. Mark some files (or the root of the folder tree which
is equivalent to marking all files in this folder). Now choose
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Update</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> (Of course, you could have chosen this at the beginning of
the session). For some
of the files the status may change now. Typically, files which had "Needs
Patch" or "Needs Update" are updated. So the following new items are possible
in the status column:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Updated</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
Shown if the file was updated from the repository.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Patched</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
Indicates that the &CVS; server has sent a patch for this file and
the patch has been successfully applied. If the patch was not successful
because there was a conflict between your modifications and those someone else
committed to the repository, the status is now <guilabel>Conflict</guilabel>.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>
You may have noticed that according to the status of the file, its row has a
different color. The colors are chosen to somehow reflect the priority of the
status. For example, a file with a conflict is marked red to show you that you
have to resolve a conflict before you can continue working with the file. If
your folder contains a high number of files, you may nevertheless lose the
overview. To get more concise information about which files have an unusual
status, simply click on the header of the <guilabel>Status</guilabel>
column. The file list is then sorted by priority, so you have all important
information at the top of the list. To get back to the alphabetically sorted
view, click on the header of the <guilabel>File name</guilabel> column.

<para>
All commonly used &CVS; functionality is directly available in &cervisia;'s
main view. Commands usually act on several files at once, namely all which
currently selected. If the selection includes folders, its interpretation
depends on the settings made under the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu. For
example, if <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Commit &amp;
Remove Recursively</guimenuitem></menuchoice> is checked and you choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Commit...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
while a folder is selected, then all files in the tree under that folder
are committed. Otherwise, only the regular files in the folder itself are
affected.

The most used actions are also available by right clicking the files in the tree

&cervisia;'s main window context menu.
</para>

<para>
You can simply edit a file by double-clicking on it or selecting it and pressing
&Enter;. This starts the default application that handles that
file type (the default application for each file type is a &kde; wide setting). If
the default application is not the one you want to use, you can right click the
file and choose the
<menuchoice>
<guisubmenu>Edit With</guisubmenu>
</menuchoice>
submenu, and select one of the other applications that handle that file type.
</para>

<sect1 id="addingfiles">
<title>Adding Files</title>

<para>
Adding files to a project requires two steps: first, the files must be
registered with &CVS;, or in other words,
<emphasis>added to the repository</emphasis>. This is necessary, but not
sufficient. In order to actually put the files into the repository, you must
<emphasis>commit</emphasis> them. This procedure has an important advantage:
you can commit the files together with modifications to other parts of the
project. When doing this, one can easily see (&eg; in commit emails) that all
these changes are part of a whole.
</para>

<para>
To this end, mark all files to be added in &cervisia;'s
main view. Then, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Add to
Repository...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, or right click the marked files and
choose <guimenuitem>Add to Repository...</guimenuitem>. The
<guilabel>CVS Add</guilabel> dialog will appear, listing the files you marked, and
asks for confirmation. Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
</para>

<para>&cervisia; issues a command</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs add <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
If the operation was successful, the status column should have "Added to
repository" for the added files.
</para>

<warning><para>
&CVS; is not designed to provide meaningful revision control for binary
files. For example, merging binary files normally does not make
sense. Furthermore, by default &CVS; performs keyword expansion (&eg; on the
string <literal>&dollar;Revision: 1.6 &dollar;</literal>) when a file is committed. In binary
files, such replacements may corrupt the file and make it completely
unusable.
</para></warning>

<para>
In order to switch the above behavior off, you should commit binary files
(or other files, like Postscript or PNG images) by choosing
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Add Binary...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
The <guilabel>CVS Add</guilabel> dialog will appear, listing the binary files
you marked, and asks for confirmation. Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.

<sect1 id="removingfiles">
<title>Removing Files</title>

<para>
Like adding files, removing files is done in two steps: First, the files have
to be registered as removed by choosing
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Remove From
Repository...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or right clicking the marked files and
choosing <guimenuitem>Remove From Repository...</guimenuitem> from the context
menu. The <guilabel>CVS Remove</guilabel> dialog will appear, listing the files
you marked, and asking for confirmation. Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
&cervisia; issues the command
</para>
<para>
<screen><command>cvs remove -f <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
After that, this modification to the sandbox has to be committed, possibly
together with other modifications to the project.
</para>

<note><para>
The above command only works if the file is up-to-date. Otherwise, you get an
error message. This behavior is sensible: If you have modified the file
compared to the version in the repository, or if someone else has made any
modifications, you will first want to check if you really want to discard
them.
</para></note>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="addingremovingdirs">
<title>Adding and Removing Folders</title>

<para>
Folders are handled fundamentally different from ordinary files by
&CVS;. They are not under revision control, &ie; you cannot tell which
folders existed in the project at a certain time. Furthermore, folders
can never be explicitly removed (except by removing them directly in the
repository).
</para>

<para>
As a substitute, &CVS; follows the convention that a folder is "non-existent"
in a version of the project if it is empty. This convention can be
enforced by using the option <option>-P</option> to <command>cvs
update</command> and <command>cvs checkout</command>. This option can be set
in the menu <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Prune Empty
Folders on Update</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para>

<para>
A folder can be added to the repository choosing 
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Add to
Repository...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or right clicking the marked folder and
choosing <guimenuitem>Add to Repository...</guimenuitem> from the context menu.
Note that in contrast to adding files, adding folders does not require a commit
afterwards. &cervisia; issues the command

<para>

</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="committingfiles">
<title>Committing Files</title>

<para>
When you have made a certain number of changes to your working copy, and you
want other developers to have access to them, you <emphasis>commit</emphasis>
them. With a commit, you place your versions of the modified files as new
revisions into the repository. A subsequent update by another developer will
bring your modifications into their working copy.
</para>

<para>
In order to commit a couple of files, select them in &cervisia;'s main view and
choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Commit...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
or right click the marked files and choose
<guimenuitem>Commit...</guimenuitem> from the context menu.
</para>

<figure id="screenshot-commit" float="1">
<title>A screenshot of &cervisia;'s commit dialog</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="commit.png"/></imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
You get a dialog that shows you a list of the selected files on the top section
and a log message for your changes below. &cervisia; helps you in several ways
to find a meaningful log message: first, in the file list you can double-click
a file or press <keycap>Return</keycap> in order to see the changes you have
made to the file. Second, it gives you a list of log messages you have
previously used in a combo box. Third, this dialog is integrated with
&cervisia;'s changelog editor described below. When you have finished the
dialog, the command
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs commit -m <replaceable>message</replaceable> <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
is used.
</para>


<note><para>
A common error you may encounter when committing is <errorname>Up-to-date check
failed</errorname>. This indicates that someone has committed changes to the
repository since you last updated; or, more technically, that your
<literal>BASE</literal> revision is not the newest on its branch. In such a
case, &CVS; refuses to merge your modifications into the repository. The
solution is to update, resolve any conflicts and commit again. Of course, if
you are working on a software project, it is normally good style to check if
the program still works after you have updated - after all, there could be bad
interactions between your modifications and the other modifications which
break the code.
</para></note>

<note>
<para>
Another popular mistake results in the error message <errorname>Sticky tag 'X'
for file 'X' is not a branch</errorname>. This happens if you try to commit a
file which you have previously brought to a certain revision or tag with the command
</para>
<para>
<screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>cvs update -r X</userinput></screen>
</para>
<para>
(which is &eg; used by the menu item
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Update to
Tag/Date...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>). In such a case, the tag on the file
gets sticky, &ie; further updates do not bring you to the newest revision on
the branch. If you want to commit further revisions to the branch, you have to
update to the branch tag before you do further commits.
</para>
</note>

<para>
With &cervisia;, it is quite easy to maintain a ChangeLog file that is
compliant with the format laid out in the &GNU; coding guidelines. To use it,
choose <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Insert ChangeLog
Entry...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. If a file with the name
<filename>ChangeLog</filename> exists in the toplevel folder of your
sandbox, this file will be loaded and you have the possibility to edit it. To
this end, at the top of the file, an entry with the current date and your user
name (which can be configured as described in <xref
linkend="customize-general"/>) is inserted. When you are finished the dialog can 
be closed by clicking <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, the next commit dialog you open
will have the log message set to the message you last entered in the ChangeLog. 
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="resolvingconflicts">
<title>Resolving Conflicts</title>

<para>
Conflicts may occur whenever you have made changes to a file which was also
modified by another developer. The conflict is detected by &CVS; when you
update the modified file; &CVS; then tries to merge the modifications committed
by the other developer into your working copy. The merge fails if both your
and his modifications are in overlapping parts of the file, and the &CVS;
server issues an error message.
</para>

<para>
In &cervisia;'s main view, files with conflicts are indicated with "Conflict"
in the status column and with a red color. It is your job now to resolve these
conflicts before you commit the file. &CVS; will refuse to commit any files with
conflicts until they have been edited. From the main view, you can of
course resolve conflicts the traditional way: just double-click the file in
question and edit it with your favorite editor.</para>

<para>
&CVS; marks the conflicting changes by placing marks in the middle
of the files, in the following manner:</para>

<screen>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Changes in your working copy
=======
Changes in the repository
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; revision_number
</screen>

<para>You should replace this whole block with the new merged version. Of
course, you have a great amount of freedom when resolving a
set of conflicts: for each conflict you can decide to take one of the two
alternative versions. You can also decide that both approaches are broken
and rewrite a whole routine or the complete file from scratch.
</para>

<para>
Fortunately, &cervisia; offers a nicer interface for handling these conflicts.
This does not mean that you will never need to manually edit the files, but
at least can eliminate the need to do so for the trivial conflict resolution.
To use &cervisia;'s <guilabel>CVS Resolve</guilabel> dialog choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Resolve...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
or right click the marked file and choose
<guimenuitem>Resolve...</guimenuitem> from the context menu.

</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
On the top of the dialog, you see <guilabel>Your version (A)</guilabel> of the
file on the left hand side and the version in the repository, <guilabel>Other
version (B)</guilabel>, on the right hand side. The differences
between them are marked in red color. Below these two versions, you can see
the <guilabel>Merged version</guilabel>. The merged version reflects what that
section will be in your working copy if you press the <guibutton>Save</guibutton>
button.
</para>

<para>
You can go back and forward between the conflicting sections by pressing
<guibutton>&lt;&lt;</guibutton> and <guibutton>&gt;&gt;</guibutton>. In the
lower middle of the dialog you can see which section is currently marked. For
example, <literal>2 of 3</literal> means that you are currently at the second
differing section of 3 total.
</para>

<para>
Now can can decide section by section which version you want to have in the
merged file. By pressing <guibutton>A</guibutton>, you take over the version you
edited. By pressing <guibutton>B</guibutton>, you take over the version from the
repository. By pressing <guibutton>A+B</guibutton>, both versions will be added,
and your version will come first. <guibutton>B+A</guibutton> yields the same
result, but the order will be different: first the repository version, then
yours.
</para>

<para>
If you are not happy with any of these versions, press
<guibutton>Edit</guibutton> to open a simple text editor where you can
edit the section. When you are finished editing, press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
to return to the <guilabel>CVS Resolve</guilabel> dialog and resume solving
conflicts. You will see the section you just edited in the
<guilabel>Merged version</guilabel>, with your modifications.
</para>

<para>
To save your modifications, overwriting the working copy version, press
<guibutton>Save</guibutton>. Note that this will save the choices not only the
section you are currently viewing, but all sections in the file. If you want to
save it to another file, press <guibutton>Save As...</guibutton>.
Press <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to exit the dialog. If you close the dialog
without saving, the changes you made will be lost.

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
In the main view, you can choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Difference to
Repository (BASE)...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. This is based on the command
<command>cvs diff</command> and shows you the differences between the version
in your sandbox and the version to which you last updated (also known as
<literal>BASE</literal>). This is in particular useful just before you commit
a file, so you can find an appropriate log message.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
You can view the differences between the version in your sandbox and the version
in the main development branch (also called <literal>HEAD</literal>) by choosing
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Difference to Repository (HEAD)...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
You can view the differences between the last two revisions of the selected file
choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>

<guimenuitem>Last Change...</guimenuitem> menu items from the main view context
menu, by right-clicking the file you want to view.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
In the dialog that is shown when a you commit a set of files, you can request
a difference window by selecting a file name in the selection list, either by
double-clicking it or by pressing <keycap>Return</keycap>. This is quite
similar to using <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Difference

main view. 
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
In the Browse Logs dialog, you can mark two revisions of a file and request a
dialog showing the differences between them (see <xref linkend="browsinglogs"/>).
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
As you may have expected, &cervisia; does not just dump the output of the
<command>diff</command> command into your terminal, but shows you a graphical
view as seen in <xref linkend="screenshot-log"/>.
</para>

</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
The text in the dialog is an improved variant of the text given by the diff
command with the <option>-u</option> option. You can see the differing
versions in two windows, with lines arranged such that you can do a
side-by-side comparison. That means, where text has been added or deleted,
the respective window shows empty lines with the marker
<literal>+++++</literal> at the left hand side. Elsewhere, you can see the
running number of each line in the left column.
</para>

<para>
In the second column in the right window, you can see which kind of change has
been made. Possible types are <literal>Add</literal>,
<literal>Delete</literal> and <literal>Change</literal>. The respective lines
are marked in blue, green and red color. In the middle of the dialog a
compressed image of the color markers is shown. In this way, you can get a
quick overview of the overall changes to the file. You can also use the
position of the colored regions in the compressed image as an orientation when
you using the scroll bars.
</para>

<para>
Normally, the scrollbars at the left and the right window are synchronized,
&ie; if you scroll on the left hand side, the right hand side is scrolled by
the same amount. You can change this by checking the box
<guibutton>Synchronize scroll bars</guibutton>.

<sect1 id="creatingpatches">
<title>Creating Patches</title>

<para>
Sometimes you want to offer your modifications for review, before committing them,
or you do not have write access to the repository (therefore you cannot
commit). &CVS; offers standard formats to share the modifications in
your working copy, so other people can review your changes, test them in their
working copy and apply them to the &CVS; repository. A file containing these
differences is called a <firstterm>patch</firstterm>, and is generated by the
<command>cvs diff</command> command, in the same way as the differences in
<xref linkend="diff"/>. Sharing patches instead of sets of files requires less
bandwidth, and patches are easier to handle, as you can send only one patch
file containing all the differences from many source files.
</para>

<para>
&cervisia; gives you access to this feature by choosing
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Create Patch Against Repository...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para>

<important><para>
The <guimenuitem>Create Patch Against Repository...</guimenuitem> action
creates a patch with all modifications in all files in your working copy
(sandbox) against the <literal>BASE</literal> repository. Therefore, the
selection of files in the main view does not affect the patch that will be
generated.
</para></important>

<para>
Another possibility is to select one file in the main view and choose
<guimenuitem>Browse Log...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu
or right click the marked file and choose
<guimenuitem>Browse Log...</guimenuitem> from the context menu, in order to open
the <link linkend="browsinglogs">Browse log dialog</link>. Now, select the
version you want to create a patch against, as revision &quot;A&quot; and press
the button <guilabel>Create Patch...</guilabel>. This will generate a patch with
the differences between the <emphasis>marked file</emphasis> in your working
copy and the version selected as revision &quot;A&quot;.
</para>

<para>
Before generating the patch, &cervisia; displays a dialog allowing you to
configure the output format.

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Output Format</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
There are three output formats available:
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Normal</guilabel>: a format that can be used to cause the ed editor
to automatically make another copy of the old file match the new file. In
the normal output format, the characters &lt; and &gt; mark the changes, and
there is no context information.
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Unified</guilabel>: the most used format for
exchanging patches. The unified format uses context lines in addition to line
numbers to record the differences. This makes the process of
applying patches more robust. This format displays the
differences in a compact and readable form, with a header for each file
involved, and separate sections (chunks) for each difference. The context lines
available for each difference make reading the modifications easier. In
the unified output format, the characters + and - mark the changes.
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Context</guilabel>, which presents the same information as the unified
format, but in a less compact way. In the context output format, the character !
marks the changes.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Number of context lines:</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
Set here the number of context lines for the unified or context output formats.
This option is not available for the normal output format, as in this format
no context information is recorded. More context information makes reading the
raw output easier, and applying the patch more precise, but increases the patch
size. It is recommended to use at least two context lines for proper patch
operation.
</para></listitem>

<term><guilabel>Ignore Options</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>
Check here the changes that should not be considered as differences when

<title>Watching an Annotated View of a File</title>

<para>
With the command <command>cvs annotate</command>, &CVS; offers the possibility
to see - for each line in a file - who has modified a line the most recently.
This view may be helpful in order to find out who has introduced a change in
the behavior of a program or who should be asked about some change or bug in
the code.
</para>

<para>
&cervisia; gives you access to this feature, but it further enriches the
information in an interactive way. You obtain an annotate view by choosing
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Annotate...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
Another possibility is to press the button <guilabel>Annotate</guilabel> in
the <link linkend="browsinglogs">Browse log dialog</link>, in which you can
select which version of the file you want to display.
In <xref linkend="screenshot-annotate"/> you can see a screenshot of the
dialog.

<para>
In the annotate dialog, you see in a window the latest version of the selected
file (or the revision &quot;A&quot; version, in case you launched the annotate
dialog from the <link linkend="browsinglogs">Browse log dialog</link>). In
the columns before the text, you get some information related to the
latest change in each line. In the first column the line number is
displayed. In the second column you see the name of the author and
revision number. Finally, in the third column you see the actual content of that
line. 
</para>

<para>
Consequently, when a certain line appears strange to you or you assume a bug
there, you can immediately see who is responsible for that line. But not only
that, you can also find out <emphasis>why</emphasis> that line was
changed. To this end, move the mouse cursor over the respective revision
number. Then a tooltip appears that shows the log message and the date of the
change.

<para>
You can choose to see the history as provided by the <command>cvs
log</command> command (<guilabel>CVS Output</guilabel>), as a
<guilabel>Tree</guilabel>, or in <guilabel>List</guilabel> form. What you prefer
is of course a matter of taste and it depends on what information you are
interested in. The tree is an intuitive representation of what has been done
on different branches by which authors. As tooltips, you can see the corresponding
log messages. The list is by its nature linear and, therefore, does not give an
immediate view of branches; on the other hand, it concentrates more otherwise
relevant information on less screen estate, namely the time of each change of
the file and the first part of the log message. The &CVS; output information is
complete, but long, and difficult to read. To alleviate these problems, you
have the ability to search the text of the &CVS; output, by pressing the
<guibutton>Find...</guibutton> button. 
</para>

<para>
To obtain more information about a certain revision, you can click on it
either in the list or the tree view. The fields in the middle of the dialog
are then filled with the complete information provided by <command>cvs
log</command>. You can mark two revisions, called &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, which are
relevant if you make use of further features provided by the buttons.
Revision &quot;A&quot; can be chosen with the left mouse button, revision &quot;B&quot;
with the middle one. In the list view, you can also
navigate with with your cursor keys. In order to mark revisions &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;,
use the shortcuts <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>A</keycap></keycombo>,
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>B</keycap></keycombo>, respectively.
Using the <guilabel>CVS Output</guilabel> view, you can click on the
<guilabel>Select for revision A</guilabel> and <guilabel>Select for
revision B</guilabel> to mark the revisions.
</para>

<para>
If you press the <guibutton>Annotate</guibutton> button, you get a dialog
showing the text of file belonging to the revision marked as &quot;A&quot;.
Every line is prefixed with the information about who edited this last time,
and at which revision this happened. You can get more information about viewing
annotated versions in <xref linkend="annotate" />.
</para>

<para>
If you press the <guibutton>Diff</guibutton> button, a <command>cvs diff</command>
call is issued and you get a dialog in which all the modifications between the
two marked revisions are shown. If you mark revision &quot;A&quot;, but not
revision &quot;B&quot;, &cervisia; will generate the modifications between
the file version marked as revision &quot;A&quot; and the working copy version
of the file. This allows you to view the differences between your version of the
file and any version available in &CVS;. To make it easy to see the changes,
different colors are used to mark lines which have been added, removed or simply
changed. You can get more information about viewing differences in
<xref linkend="diff" />.
</para>

<para>
If you press the <guibutton>Create Patch...</guibutton> button, you get a dialog
in which you can set the format options for generating a file containing all the
modifications between the two marked revisions which are shown. If you mark
revision &quot;A&quot;, but not revision &quot;B&quot;, &cervisia; will generate
the modifications between the file version marked as revision &quot;A&quot; and
the working copy version of the file. This allows you to generate a patch, or
difference file, between your version of the file and any version available in
&CVS;. After configuring the format of the patch in the dialog, and pressing
<guibutton>OK</guibutton>, a <command>cvs diff</command> command is issued to
generate the difference file. A <guilabel>Save As</guilabel> dialog will pop up.
Enter the file name and location of the patch file &cervisia; generated, in order

<sect1 id="updatingto">
<title>Updating to Tag, Branch or Date</title>

<para>
Branches of a module are parallel versions of this module. A good real life
example of the use of this feature is the release of a software project. After a
major release, there are bugs in the code that should be fixed, but people want
to add new features to the application too. It is very hard to do both at the
same time because new features usually introduce new bugs, making it hard to
track down the old ones. To solve this dilemma, &CVS; lets you create a parallel
version, that we will call the &quot;stable release branch&quot;, where you can
only add bugfixes, leaving the main branch (HEAD) open for adding new features.
</para>

<para>
Tags are used to mark a version of a project. &CVS; stamps one
version of each file with the tag, so when you checkout or
update to a specific tag, you will get always the same file versions;
therefore, as opposed to branches, tags are not dynamic: you cannot develop a
tag. Tags are useful to mark releases, big changes in the code, &etc;
</para>

<para>
When you are developing or following the development of a software project,
you do not necessarily work with the main branch all the time. After a release,
you may want to stay with the released branch for a while, to enjoy its relative
stability, fix bugs, translate the sources, &etc; To do all that, you have to
update to the released branch. All your files will be updated to the latest
version of the files in that branch. After updating, all your new commits will
be uploaded to the new branch as well.
</para>

<para>
Also, if you want to track a bug that was reported
against a past tagged release, &CVS; offers you the possibility to retrieve the
software as it was released, by updating to that tag. Besides, if you want to
fetch a past version of your project, you can update your working copy to a
specific date. This may be useful if an error was introduced in the project
between two releases, and you have an opinion on when that was. When you update
to a date or tag, the versions of your files will be the same as the versions
in that specific date or the versions stamped by that tag.
</para>

<warning><para>
Before updating to a different branch or tag, make sure you committed all your
changes to the branch you are working with. If your are not ready to
commit your changes, but do not want to discard them, do not update to the new
branch, as you may lose your changes. As an alternative, you can do a new
<link linkend="checkingout">checkout</link>, to work in parallel with
both versions.

<sect1 id="taggingbranching">
<title>Tagging and Branching</title>

<para>
We discuss here only the technical aspects of tagging and branching. If you
are only a <emphasis>user</emphasis>, not the administrator of the repository,
you will probably not be confronted with the problem. If however you are your
own administrator, you should first read about the non-technical problems that
accompany branching, in order to get an impression of how time-consuming and
error-prone maintaining different branches of a project can be. The appendix
includes some references about this topic.
</para>

<para>
Simple tagging is something you usually do when a release is made, so that you
can at any time easily get back to the project state at that time. Tags are
usually given a name consisting of the project name and the version
number. For example, &cervisia; 1.0 is available under the tag
<literal>CERVISIA_1_0</literal>. &cervisia; enforces &CVS;'s strict rules
about what constitutes valid tag name. It must begin with a letter and may
contain letters, digits, hyphens and underscores.
</para>

<para> 
Normally, you will want to tag the whole project (although &CVS; of course
allows you to tag only a subset). To this end, mark the toplevel folder in
the view and choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Tag/Branch</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
Now enter the name of the tag, press <keycap>Return</keycap> and you are done.
</para>

<para>
Creating a branch is not significantly more difficult: In the tag dialog,
check the box <guibutton>Create branch with this tag</guibutton>. You can also
delete an existing tag: Choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Delete
Tag</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the main view.
</para>

<para>
Another aspect of branching is the merging of modifications from a branch to
the current branch. If you are going to do this, choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Merge...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
The dialog that appears now gives you two options:
</para>

<para>
Either you may merge all modifications done on a branch to the current
branch. In that case, check the box <guibutton>Merge from branch</guibutton>
and fill in the branch you want to merge from. &cervisia; will then execute
the command
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs update <option>-j</option> <replaceable>branchtag</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
The other possibility is that you want to merge only the modifications made
between two tags on a branch. This usually happens when you merge from the
same branch to the trunk several times. In that case, check the box
<guibutton>Merge modifications</guibutton> and enter (in the correct order)
the two relevant tags. This will result in a command
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs update <option>-j</option> <replaceable>branchtag1</replaceable> <option>-j</option> <replaceable>branchtag2</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="watches">
<title>Using Watches</title>

<para>
A watch is the conventional name for &CVS;'s feature to notify users of the
repository whenever a file has been changed or a developer has started editing
a file. The usage of watches requires that the file
<filename><envar>$CVSROOT</envar>/CVSROOT/notify</filename> has been set up
properly. This is not discussed here; if you need further information on the
setup from the administrator's point of view, read one of the books listed in
the appendix.
</para>

<para>
&cervisia;'s main support of watches are six menu items.
</para>

<para>
In order to add a watch to one or several files, use
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Add
Watch...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. In the dialog you get, you can choose to
get notified for any of the types of events that &CVS; supports. For example,
if you only want to get notified when a file is committed, check the boxes
<guibutton>Only</guibutton> and <guibutton>Commits</guibutton>. If you want to
get notified about any event related to the marked files, check the box
<guibutton>All</guibutton>. The command line used when you accept the dialog
is
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs watch add -a commit <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
or with a similar option, depending on the events you chose to watch.
</para>

<para>
If you are not interested in some files anymore, you can remove your watches on
them. To this end, use
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Remove
Watch...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. In the dialog you get here, the same
options are offered as in the form you filled out when adding the watch. When
you confirm this dialog, &cervisia; issues the command
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs watch remove <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
possibly with an option <option>-a</option> for the chosen events. 
</para>

<para>
Finally, you can get a list of the people who are watching a couple of
files. Choose <menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show
Watchers</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Using this menu item will result in a
command
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs watchers <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
In the normal usage scenario of &CVS;, each developer works separately in his
checked out sandbox. When he wants to modify some file, he can just open it in
his editor and start working on it. Nobody else will know about this work
until the file gets committed.
</para>

<para>
For some developer groups, this is not the preferred model of
cooperation. They want to get notified about someone working on a file
<emphasis>as soon as</emphasis> he starts with it. This can be achieved by some
further &CVS; commands. Before you start editing a file, select it in
&cervisia;'s main window and choose 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit Files</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
This will execute the command
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs edit <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
This will send out a notification to everyone who has set an
<literal>edit</literal> watch on this file. It will also register you as an
<emphasis>editor</emphasis> of the file. You can obtain a list of all editors
of a certain file by using
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show
Editors</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. This is equivalent to typing on the
command line
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>cvs editors <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
An editing session is automatically ended when you commit the affected file.
At that moment, an <literal>unedit</literal> notification gets sent out to all
people who have registered a respective watch on the file. Of course,
sometimes you may not want to commit the file, but abort the editing session
and revert to the previous version of the file. This is done by using
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Unedit Files</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
Note that &cervisia; will not ask you for confirmation; that means if you use
this menu item, all your work done since you used
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit Files</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
will be lost. Precisely, &cervisia; uses the command line
</para>

<para>
<screen><command>echo y | cvs unedit <replaceable>file names</replaceable></command></screen>
</para>

<para>
So far, we have only discussed the case where edits and unedits are used
voluntarily be the developers. In addition &CVS; supports a model which
<emphasis>enforces</emphasis> the usage of these commands. The responsible
command to switch to this model is <command>cvs watch on</command> which we
will not explain further because it is mostly used by the administrator of the
repository. However, the important point from the developer's point of view is
that when the project enforces edits, working copies are checked out
<emphasis>readonly</emphasis>. That means you cannot edit a file by default
(unless you use tricks like <command>chmod</command>). Only when you use 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit Files</guimenuitem></menuchoice>,
the file becomes writable. It is made read-only again when you commit the file
or use
<menuchoice><guimenu>Advanced</guimenu><guimenuitem>Unedit Files</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para>

<para>
&cervisia;'s editor interface helps you with projects that enforce watches
also in a different way. If you just started an editor with a readonly file
by double-clicking on it or by using
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit</guimenuitem></menuchoice>,
you would not be able to save your modifications later. This has of course a
reason: Whenever you want to change a file, you should run <command>cvs
edit</command> before, so that all people watching the file get a notification
that you are working on it.
</para>

<para>
In such a case, it is advisable to check the option
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Do cvs edit Automatically
When Necessary</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Now, whenever you edit a file by
double-clicking it, &cervisia; will run <command>cvs edit</command> before the
editor is actually executed. Then you can edit your file as usual. When you
have finished your work, commit your files, and the committed files are
read-only again.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="locking">
<title>Locking</title>

<para>
The development model usually followed when &CVS; is used is called
<emphasis>unreserved checkouts</emphasis>. Each developer has his own sandbox
where he can edit files as he likes. If when the watch features - like
<command>cvs edit</command> - are used, multiple developers can work on files
synchronously. Changes done by a different developer are merged into the local
sandbox when an update is performed.
</para>

<para>
Other revision control systems - like <acronym>RCS</acronym> and
<application>SourceSafe</application> use a different model. When a developer
wants to a edit a file, he has to <emphasis>lock</emphasis> it. Only one
developer at a time can a lock a file. When he has finished editing, the lock
is released. On the one hand, with this model, conflicts can never happen. On
the other hand, two developers cannot work on the same file at the same time,
even when their changes do not affect each other. This can be a bottleneck.
We are not going to discuss the organizational benefits of both approaches.
Nevertheless we mention that although &CVS; has some support for locking, it is
not the preferred way of working with &CVS;. You should not use these features
unless you are sure that your project manager allows them.
</para>

With &cervisia;, you lock files as follows. Select the desired files in the

<para>
In its main file tree, &cervisia; does not display all files which are
actually there. This is analog to <command>cvs</command> itself and helps to
avoid clutter caused by uninteresting stuff like object files. &cervisia;
tries to mimic <command>cvs</command>'s behavior as close as possible,
&ie; it gets ignore lists from the following sources:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para> 
A static list of entries which includes things like <literal
role="extension">*.o</literal> and <filename>core</filename>. For details,
see the &CVS; documentation.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> 
The file <filename><envar>$HOME</envar>/.cvsignore</filename>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> 
The environment variable <envar>$CVSIGNORE</envar>.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> 
The <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file in the respective folder.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
<command>cvs</command> itself additionally looks up entries in
<filename><envar>$CVSROOT</envar>/CVSROOT/cvsignore</filename>, but this is a
file on the server, and &cervisia; should be able to start up offline. If you
are working with a group that prefers to use an ignore list on the server,
it's probably a good idea to take a look which patterns are listed there and
to put them into the <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file in your home
folder.
